# ebay-fr-template
I've got a task to create a responsive ebay listing template. Ebay put the html into a frame. No js allowed.


-eBay supports all kind of devices, so the template should be completely responsive</br>
-using a 3rd party program as a lister, so I am being able to intergrate the template and receive an information as a variable</br>
-set up to receive an information from the 3rd party program and implement it to the template using a placeholder {}
